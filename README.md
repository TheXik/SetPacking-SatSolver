# SetPacking-SatSolver Documentation

## Set Packing Problem Description

Set packing is a classical NP-complete problem in computational complexity theory and combinatorics, and was one of Karp's 21 NP-complete problems. Suppose one has a finite set `S` and a subsets `S`. Then, the set packing problem asks if some `T` subsets are pairwise disjoint (in other words, no two of them share an element).

More formally, given a universe `U` and a family `S` of subsets of `U`, a packing is a subfamily `C âŠ† S` of sets such that all sets in `C` are pairwise disjoint. The size of the packing is `|C|`. 

The input is an integer : set_packing_size `T` and sets `S` each on different line splitted with a space.  
The question is whether there is a set packing of size `T` or more.


## How to Use

I am using sat solver `Glucose 4.2.1`.

### To compile you need

1. `Python 3` installed
2. A **UNIX-based system** (or WSL for Windows users).
3. A compiled version of the **Glucose SAT solver**:


## Input Format

- **Instance File**: The input file describes:
  - A target set packing size `T`.
  - A set of `n` subsets `S`, each defined on a separate line.
- **Example Input** (`instances/small_input_sat.in`):
    first line`set packing size`

    second line `element_of_set element_of_set element_of_set .....`

    third line `element_of_set element_of_set element_of_set .....`

    fourth line `element_of_set element_of_set element_of_set .....`

    fifth line `...................`

    `...........`

    n-th line `....................`

    1. The first line specifies the target packing size, `T = 3`.
    2. Subsequent lines represent the subsets:
        - Set 1: 1 2
        - Set 2: 3 4
        - Set 3: 2 3
        - Set 4: 5
        - Set 5: 5 6

    The goal is to find at least 3 subsets that are pairwise disjoint (no overlapping elements)
    #### Output

    The SAT solver outputs the solution as SATISFIABLE. 
    And as we can see the 1. set  2. and 4. are pairwise disjoint they share no same element.
